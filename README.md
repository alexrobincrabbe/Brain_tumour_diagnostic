## Project Dataset

The dataset consists of 7023 MRI scans. The scans are split into four classes: glioma, healthy, meningioma, pituitary. 

The data can be found at https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/rm1000/brain-tumor-mri-scans

## Business Requirements

The demand for MRI-based diagnostics is increasing, with over a million MRI brain scans conducted annually in hospitals and clinics worldwide. Radiologists often face the challenge of reviewing large volumes of images under pressure, which can lead to delays and diagnostic inconsistencies. Early and accurate diagnosis is critical for treatment planning and improving patient outcomes, particularly for conditions like glioma and meningioma that require timely intervention. There is a need for an automated solution to assist radiologists in identifying and classifying brain abnormalities swiftly and accurately.

The institution requires an automated solution to:

- 1 Provide visual insights into the nature of different categories through image analysis
- 2 Reduce diagnostic time by quickly categorizing brain scans into four key categories: glioma, meningioma, pituitary tumor, and healthy cases.

## Hypothesis and How to Validate

- Hypothesis: A machine learning model, using convolutional neural networks (CNNs), can accurately classify MRI brain scans into four categoriesâ€”glioma, meningioma, pituitary tumor, and healthy and assit radialogists by providing quick reliable predictions.

- How to validate: Measure key metrics such as accuracy, precision, recall for each of the four categories.

## ML Business Case

- We aim to develop a machine learning model to predict whether a brain MRI scan falls into one of four categories: glioma, meningioma, pituitary tumor, or healthy. The model is a supervised, multi-class, single-label classification model based on historical MRI scan image data.
- Our ideal outcome is to provide radiologists with a faster and more reliable diagnostic tool to classify MRI brain scans, assisting them in identifying brain abnormalities or confirming healthy cases more accurately and efficiently.
- The model success metrics are:
    * Recall and precision of at least 0.7 accross all labels

- The model output is defined as a label for the MRI scan, indicating the predicted category (glioma, meningioma, pituitary tumor, or healthy) along with the associated probability score for each category. The medical team will upload MRI scans to the App, and predictions will be made on the fly, not in batches. These predictions can be used by radiologists as a support tool during their diagnostic process.
Heuristics:
- The current diagnostic process for detecting brain abnormalities in MRI scans requires experienced radiologists to carefully analyze images, often involving manual inspection. The process is time-consuming and subject to human variability, which can lead to errors or inconsistencies in diagnosis. This is especially problematic in under-resourced hospitals or diagnostic centers that are experiencing high demand and understaffing.
By introducing an AI-powered diagnostic tool, radiologists will be able to make faster, more consistent decisions, improving the quality of patient care. Furthermore, the tool will assist in areas where there is a shortage of radiologists, helping to alleviate diagnostic bottlenecks.

## Modelling

- The model contains 3 2d-convolution layers

- The 3 max pooling layers are needed to reduce the size of the image

- The flatten layer converts the pixel values to a 1-D array

- At least one dense layer is required for the parameter fitting

- The output activation function is softmax, as there are 4 categorical lables to be predicted

- The loss function is categorical cross entropy

### Model Tuning

- Batch size was increased from 20 to 40 to increase performance. As the set contains 4 labels, rather than a binary classifiction, it was supposed that a larger batch size would be necessary to fit each iteration of the model. Increasing above 40 didn't show any benefit.

- The total number of epochs were increased from 15 to 50, as the model appeared to still be improving up to 30 epochs and beyond

- The early stopping toleranz was increased from 3 to 6, as the validation loss showed large variability between epochs, and this caused training to sometimes be stoppped earlier than is should

- As meningioma showed the worst performance of all of the labels, a higher weight was given to this label to improve performance. However improving performance with the meningioma category appears to come at a cost of the performance in the glioma category. Increasing weights in both glioma and meningioma were also tried.

- Note: only the final model is stored in the github repository, in order to keep the repository size within the limits for deployment on Heroku
